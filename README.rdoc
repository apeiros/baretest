= Bare Test



== Summary

A testframework that doesn't stand in your way or forces you to learn a new
language. Two methods is all that is required to know.
If you need it, it provides you with all kinds of features to support you
writing your tests.

                  mean I'm in front of the computer.



== Description

Baretest is a Testframework that tries to stay out of your way, but support you when you want it.
In order to do so it has a load of features:

* Straightforward and terse assertions (just a block whose return value defines
  success/failure)
* Easy grouping of assertions into suites
* BDD style specifications/test descriptions (NOT code), also extractable
* Uncomplicated dependency testing and skipping
* Helpers to deal painlessly with raising, throwing, float imprecision,
  unordered collections etc.
* Ships with colored Shell formatter, Diagnostic-, XML- and TAP formatter
* Interactive mode - drops you into an irb session within failed assertion
  with all setup methods executed, so you can inspect interactively why it
  failed.
* Trivial to add new formatters (the standard formatters are only roughly 20-50
  lines of code each)
* Teardown and Setup for suites
* Callbacks to integrate mock libraries
* API to use it from code, such as rake tasks (comes with an example rake-task)
* baretest executable to run tests on multiple files at once
* Diagnostic assertion helpers (e.g. same(:a, :b) will give you 'Expected
  :a but got :b' as diagnostic)



== Quick Try

1. Download from github and unpack (or clone)
2. Change into the baretest directory: `cd the/baretest/directory`
3. Run the examples: `./bin/baretest examples/test.rb`

That's it. Alternatively you can run baretests own tests, and play with formatters:
`./bin/baretest -f tap`



== Install

1. run `gem install baretest`, alternatively run `sudo gem install baretest`
2. There is no 2.

To get baretest edge, use:

1. Download from github and unpack (or clone)
2. Change into the baretest directory: `cd the/baretest/directory`
3. Run the installation task: `rake gem:install` (alternatively `rake install:lib`)

If you have multiple ruby versions installed parallely, this might pick the wrong gem
executable to install the gem. You can set the GEM env variable to ensure it uses the
right one: `rake gem:install GEM=gem1.9`



== Executable

Usage:

  baretest [options] [glob, ...]

  Glob defaults to 'test/**/*.rb'
  Providing a directory as glob is equivalent to dir/**/*.rb
  Options:
    -f, --format FORMAT      use FORMAT for output
    -F, --formats            show available formats
    -d, --debug              set debugging flags (set $DEBUG to true)
    -i, --interactive        drop into IRB on error or failure
    -s, --setup FILE         specify setup file
    -v, --version            print the version and exit
    -w, --warn               turn warnings on for your script



== Planned Features

* Passing on flags/options for formatters
* Tagging tests to allow focusing (only run tests with/without specific tags)
* Word-wrapping for CLI runner
* Flags for color and verbose (\[no-]color and \[no-]verbose) for the executable
* baretest --init \[LAYOUT], to create the necessary directory structure
* Detect whether baretest is run from an interactive terminal or not and adjust
  defaults (no-color e.g.)
* Alternative CLI runner with status implicit via colored/bg-colored descriptions
* Alternative CLI runner which prints the name of the test prior the label and rewrites
  the line when the test has executed to add status & coloring.
* Simple stubbing with automatic cleanup at teardown. Example:

    assert "Should require a single file listed in :requires option." do |a|
      file = 'foo/bar'
      stub(Kernel, :require) do |file, *args| a.touch(file) end
      ::Test::Suite.create(nil, nil, :requires => file)
    
      touched file
    end

* Inline tests via Module#describe (basically the same as Test::Suite#suite)
* YARD code to extract the specifications without running the code
* A redmine plugin
* --fail-all flag, to test/review diagnostics of tests (no idea how to do that yet)



== Rejected Features

* Currently none


== A Bit of Background

Originally, bare-test started out as a project for shits & giggles on the flight
back from vegas (railsconf09), to prove that it is possible to have a fully
fledged test-framework in under 100 lines of source-code.
Later I realized that this project could become more. For one it was (still is)
dead simple to add another formatter, it is just as dead simple to embedd it
in code.
The principles are trivial to understand, embrace and extend.
Upon that it dawned me, that the project was viable and I began adding features
not found in other projects.



== Example Testsuite

From examples/test.rb:

  BareTest.suite do
    # assertions and refutations can be grouped in suites. They will share
    # setup and teardown
    # they don't have to be in suites, though
    suite "Success" do
      assert "An assertion returning a trueish value (non nil/false) is a success" do
        true
      end
    end
  
    suite "Failure" do
      assert "An assertion returning a falsish value (nil/false) is a failure" do
        false
      end
    end
  
    suite "Pending" do
      assert "An assertion without a block is pending"
    end
  
    suite "Error" do
      assert "Uncaught exceptions in an assertion are an error" do
        raise "Error!"
      end
    end
  
    suite "Special assertions" do
      assert "Assert a block to raise" do
        raises do
          sleep(rand()/3+0.05)
          raise "If this raises then the assertion is a success"
        end
      end
  
      assert "Assert a float to be close to another" do
        a = 0.18 - 0.01
        b = 0.17
        within_delta a, b, 0.001
      end
  
      suite "Nested suite" do
        assert "Assert two randomly ordered arrays to contain the same values" do
          a = [*"A".."Z"] # an array with values from A to Z
          b = a.sort_by { rand }
          equal_unordered(a, b) # can be used with any Enumerable, uses hash-key identity
        end
      end
    end
  
    suite "Setup & Teardown" do
      setup do
        @foo = "foo"
        @bar = "bar"
      end
  
      assert "@foo should be set" do
        @foo == "foo"
      end
  
      suite "Nested suite" do
        setup do
          @bar = "inner bar"
          @baz = "baz"
        end
  
        assert "@foo is inherited" do
          @foo == "foo"
        end
  
        assert "@bar is overridden" do
          @bar == "inner bar"
        end
  
        assert "@baz is defined only for inner" do
          @baz == "baz"
        end
      end
  
      teardown do
        @foo = nil # not that it'd make much sense, just to demonstrate
      end
    end
  
    suite "Dependencies", :requires => ['foo', 'bar'] do
      assert "Will be skipped, due to unsatisfied dependencies" do
        failure "Why the heck do you have a 'foo/bar' file?"
      end
    end
  end
