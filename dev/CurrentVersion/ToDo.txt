BUGS:
* Correct skip reason must be implemented.
* load helpers when specifying custom globs
  - look for (?:\A|/)test/ and replace with test/helpers


CHORES:
* Verify that skip works in all variants for both suite and assertion.
* Implement a callback to inform baretest about things it can ignore and about
  the expected baretest version
* Go over persistence coupling in Run
* Make baretest recognize invalid options '-:' and '-%' as selectors

MISSING TESTS:

support.rb:
  module BareTest
    def self.touch(assertion, thing=nil) # :nodoc:
    def self.touched(assertion, thing=nil) # :nodoc:
    def self.clean_touches(assertion) # :nodoc:

  module Support
    def throws_nothing # :nodoc:
    def not_touched(thing=nil)
    def extract_args(args, *named)

    suite "#verify_dependencies!" do
      assert "Should not make the suite skipped if it depends_on nothing"
      assert "Should not make the suite skipped if everything it depends_on is provided"
      assert "Should not make the suite skipped if more than everything it depends_on is provided"
      assert "Should make the suite skipped if not everything it depends_on is provided"
    end
