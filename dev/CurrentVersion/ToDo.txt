BUGS:
* `baretest -:tag` and `baretest -@status` try to use the argument as file globs
  should correctly interpret them as tag/status
* Correct skip reason must be implemented.
* load helpers when specifying custom globs
  - look for (?:\A|/)test/ and replace with test/helpers


CHORES:
* Verify that skip works in all variants for both suite and assertion.

MISSING TESTS:

support.rb:
  module BareTest
    def self.touch(assertion, thing=nil) # :nodoc:
    def self.touched(assertion, thing=nil) # :nodoc:
    def self.clean_touches(assertion) # :nodoc:
