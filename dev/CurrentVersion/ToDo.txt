BUGS:
* Correct skip reason must be implemented.
* load helpers when specifying custom globs
  - look for (?:\A|/)test/ and replace with test/helpers


CHORES:
* Verify that persistence works as expected no matter from where baretest is run
  and with what glob.
* Go over persistence coupling in Run
* Make baretest recognize invalid options '-:' and '-%' as selectors
* Examples for BareTest::Assertion::Support
* Document setup variants. Reference that documentation in relevant methods like
  Assertion#interpolated_description, Suite#component_variant_count,
  #each_component_variant, #first_component_variant


FEATURES:
* BareTest.external_file, returning an absolute path for a path relative to
  TEST/external dir
