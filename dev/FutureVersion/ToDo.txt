== BUGS:
* :requires should execute the requires upon execution instead of upon
  definition

== Planned Features

* Word-wrapping for CLI runner
* Detect whether baretest is run from an interactive terminal or not and adjust
  defaults (no-color e.g.)
* Alternative CLI runner with status implicit via colored/bg-colored descriptions
* Alternative CLI runner which prints the name of the test prior the label and rewrites
  the line when the test has executed to add status & coloring.
* Simple stubbing with automatic cleanup at teardown. Example:

    assert "Should require a single file listed in :requires option." do |a|
      file = 'foo/bar'
      stub(Kernel, :require) do |file, *args| a.touch(file) end
      ::Test::Suite.create(nil, nil, :requires => file)
    
      touched file
    end

* A redmine plugin
* --fail-all flag, to test/review diagnostics of tests (no idea how to do that yet)
