Skipping, possible reasons for a suite to be skipped:
1. Implementation pending
  An assertion with no block given
  `assert "Something"`
2. Manual skip
  A suite with the option `:skip => true/reason`
  `suite "Foo", :skip => "Depends on Feature #37" do ... end`
3. Dependency missing
  A suite with the option `:depends_on => :something` where :something
  was not provided by another suite
  `suite "Foo", :depends_on => :something do ... end`
4. Library missing
  A suite with the option `:requires => 'some/lib` where some/lib
  could not be required.
  `suite "Foo", :requires => 'not/installed/lib' do ... end`
5. Component missing
  A suite with the option `:use => :some_component` where :some_component
  is not available.
  `suite "Foo", :use => :some_component do ... end`
6. Required Tag missing -> :tags => ...
7. Excluded Tag present -> :tags => ...
8. Status mismatch -> <last run status>
