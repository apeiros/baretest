SUBJECT: [ANN] BareTest 0.3 released

I'm pleased to announce BareTest 0.3.

BareTest is a test framework.
<Insert what makes baretest great and why you'd use it, SHORT>

Installation:

  gem install baretest

Test drive:
  1. git clone git://github.com/apeiros/baretest/.git (or download from
     http://github.com/apeiros/baretest)
  2. cd into/the/repository
  3. ./bin/baretest

You can
* build the docs locally using `rake doc`
* install the checked out version as a gem using `rake gem:install`
* install the checked out version as a lib using `rake lib:install`

Learning how to use the executable: guides.apeiros.me/baretest/executable
Learning how to write baretest suites: guides.apeiros.me/baretest/tests

Example Testsuite:


Features:
By this version, baretest has gotten some - to my knowledge - unique or at least
rare features. Those include:

* Very straightforward and terse assertions (just a block whose return value
  defines success/failure).
* Various helpers to write assertions with better diagnostic messages and
  more complex tasks like raising, throwing, float imprecision, unordered
  collections etc.
* Easy grouping of assertions into suites.
* BDD style specifications/test descriptions (NOT code) that can be extracted
  without running the testcode.
* An interactive mode, letting you examine what went wrong in a failing/erroring
  test within an irb session, bound to the context of the assertion that failed,
  showing you the full code of the assertion, even including it in the readline-
  history of that irb session.
* An uncomplicated way to write pending assertions, have dependency testing and
  skip certain suites/assertions.
* A colored shell formatter, diagnostic-, XML- and TAP formatter.
* Adding your own formatters is trivial - a module with 4 methods to wrap. The
  average formatter shipped with baretest is between 20 and 50 lines.
* An API to use it from code, such as rake tasks (includes an example rake-task)
* A 'baretest' executable to run tests on multiple files at once, using a test-
  layout convention to reduce require- and setup-path-manipulation-orgies

How to quickly try baretest without installing it:

1. Download from github and unpack (or clone) - download link:
   http://github.com/apeiros/baretest/tarball/8954b17def1899a10b0e6fff39ced07f6eb722ef
2. Change into the baretest directory: `cd the/baretest/directory`
3. Run the examples: `./bin/baretest examples/test.rb`

That's it. Alternatively you can run baretest's own tests, and/or play with
formatters: `./bin/baretest -f tap`



Installing baretest

1. run `gem install baretest` (you may have to run `sudo gem install baretest`)
2. There is no 2.



Installing baretest edge

1. Download from github (or clone)
2. Run `rake gem:install` (you may have to run `sudo rake gem:install`)

Note for users with multiple ruby installations: the rake task will try to use
the right gem executable. You can force it to use a specific one by setting
the GEM env variable, e.g.: `rake gem:install GEM='gem1.9'`



Using baretest

1. In your project directory, run `baretest --init`, which will create a 'tests'
   directory with all the basic stuff already in it.
2. Write your tests
3. Run them using `baretest` in the toplevel directory of your project.


That's all folks.
Looking forward to your feedback and hope you enjoy baretest :)
