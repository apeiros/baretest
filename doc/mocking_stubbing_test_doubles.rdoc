= Mocking, Stubbing and TestDoubles

BareTest off-the-shelf provides currently only integration with mocha and rr.
They are available as components.
Until baretest 0.5 is released (which will resolve the issue), you should not
use multiple different stubbing/mocking libraries within your tests, as they
might collide (define methods with the same name e.g.).

== Mocha

Example suite using mocha:
    suite "Some suite using mocha", :use => :mocha do
      setup do
        ...FIXME...
      end

      assert FIXME do
        ...FIXME...
      end
    end

== RR

Example suite using rr:
    suite "Some suite using rr", :use => :rr do
      setup do
        ...FIXME...
      end

      assert FIXME do
        ...FIXME...
      end
    end
